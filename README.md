# Controlling-Embedded-Boards-Using-ROS

ROS interfacing of embedded controller boards and single-
board PCs. Interfaced ROS
with controllers and single computers. LDR interfacing with the Arduino, Hello
World example on the STM 32, and RGB demo on the Tiva C Launchpad. For single-board
computers, we created a basic LED blink demo using ROS.
